/* Notes */
    * SimplePHP is a PHP class for retrieval and parsing of RSS feeds. This is a wrapper to that class making it easy to use in the CakePHP framwork.
    * Much of this component is taken from the work of Scott Sansoni (http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&id=53). This is mostly an update so the component works with the lastest version of SimplePie

/* Instructions */
   1. You'll need a working version of CakePHP installed. This is running on 1.2.0.7692 RC3.
   2. Download SimplePie 1.0.1 and unzip the contents. Move the simplepie.inc to one of the vendors folders. Rename the file to simplepie.php. I like to put the file in the sub folder with the README.txt and LICENSE.txt for easy reference.
   3. Download the component and unzip it to app/controllers/components.
   4. Include the component in any controller that will need it:
      var $components = array('Simplepie');

   5. In your controller you can load a feed using:
      $items = $this->Simplepie->feed('http://feeds.feedburner.com/pseudocoder');
      $this->set('items', $items);

   6. Then to show the items in your view (you probably want to format it better than this):
      foreach($items as $item) {
        echo $html->link($item->get_title(), $item->get_permalink()) . '<br />';
      }

/* Tips */
    * This component automatically creates a directory tmp/cache/rss to store the cached feeds.
    * SimplePie has great docs. There is a ton of additional functionality that this component doesn't touch.
